Task description:

	Write the domain model for a chat service. 

	Designing a chat service is certainly far beyond the scope of what could be completed in a recruitment test. 
	Please focus only in what is a fair representation of its model.

	Entities:

	 - Users
	 - Conversations
	 - Contacts

	Behaviour:

	 - Get user profile.
	 - Add contact request.
	 - Update status message (user is online, offline, custom message)
	 - Creating private and group conversations.
	 - Send messages to private and group conversations.


Code requirements:

	1. The code should fulfil OOP and SOLID principles.
	2. The code should be maintainable.

Hint:
	- This task evaluates desing & clean code over algorithmic. 
	- There is not exact correct answer. Feel free to add more Entities and/or Behaviour
